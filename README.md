## Introduction

Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) is a proven deployment framework for professionals who build, standardize, and maintain Windows images at scale. It provides a structured way to automate operating system deployment using task sequences, rules, and a centralized deployment share. MDT is commonly used to create repeatable build processes for Windows clients and servers, including driver injection, application installation, Windows Updates, language packs, and post-install configuration.

For advanced scenarios, MDT supports robust customization through CustomSettings.ini and Bootstrap.ini, enabling dynamic logic based on model, location, role, or other environment variables. Administrators can integrate scripts (PowerShell/VBScript), control execution flow with conditions, and enforce consistent naming, domain join, and security baselines. MDT can generate WinPE boot media and leverage Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) components for imaging, servicing, and driver management.

MDT operates in Lite Touch Installation (LTI) mode for guided deployments and can be combined with Microsoft Configuration Manager for Zero Touch Installation (ZTI) workflows. This makes it suitable for labs, enterprise rollouts, refresh scenarios, and bare-metal provisioning. Its logging, monitoring, and modular step design help troubleshoot deployments and validate changes quickly.

When used by experts, MDT serves as a lean engineering toolkit, enabling users to quickly craft task sequences, run predictable imaging processes, and maintain tightly controlled deployment artifacts—all with remarkable ease.
